			<h4>Tools Used: Python, yfinance, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn =, NumPy, SciPy & Jupyter Notebook</h4>
		</header>
		<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Apple.jpg" alt="" /></a>
		<p>In this project, I performed an in-depth financial analysis and valuation of three major technology companies: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL). My focus was on leveraging data analytics to assess their financial health by analyzing income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements. I employed Python, yfinance, and Pandas for data extraction and manipulation, and used Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization to uncover trends and insights. Additionally, I conducted a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis to estimate the intrinsic value of each company and performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the impact of different assumptions on valuation. This project allowed me to apply advanced 
			data analysis techniques to understand and compare the financial metrics and market valuations of these leading tech firms. </p>
