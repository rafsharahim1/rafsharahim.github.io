			<h2><a href="#">Comprehensive Financial Analysis and Valuation of Leading Technology Companies <br />
			</a></h2>
			<h4>Tools Used: Python, yfinance, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn =, NumPy, SciPy & Jupyter Notebook</h4>
		</header>
		<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Apple.jpg" alt="" /></a>
		<p>In this project, I performed an in-depth financial analysis and valuation of three major technology companies: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL). My focus was on leveraging data analytics to assess their financial health by analyzing income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements. I employed Python, yfinance, and Pandas for data extraction and manipulation, and used Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization to uncover trends and insights. Additionally, I conducted a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis to estimate the intrinsic value of each company and performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the impact of different assumptions on valuation. This project allowed me to apply advanced 
			data analysis techniques to understand and compare the financial metrics and market valuations of these leading tech firms. </p>

			<h2><a href="#">Options Pricing: Black-Scholes vs. Machine Learning (Random Forest and XGBoost)<br />
			</a></h2>
			<h4>Tools Used: Python, yfinance, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy,  & Jupyter Notebook</h4>
		</header>
		<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/options.webp" alt="" /></a>
		<p>In this project, I explored the predictive accuracy of the traditional Black-Scholes model compared to modern machine learning models like Random Forest and XGBoost for pricing financial options. Using historical stock data from Yahoo Finance, I implemented feature engineering techniques, such as volatility calculation, to build machine learning models capable of capturing complex market behaviors. The project revealed that both Random Forest and XGBoost significantly outperformed the Black-Scholes model, particularly for out-of-the-money (OTM) options, where the flexibility of machine learning proved superior. Through model tuning and performance evaluation, XGBoost emerged as the most accurate and generalized model. This analysis demonstrates the benefits of applying data-driven 
			approaches to option pricing, highlighting the limitations of traditional models and the potential for machine learning to deliver more accurate valuations in financial markets. </p>

		<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/gold.jpg" alt="" /></a>
		<p>The gold price prediction project leverages machine learning techniques to forecast future gold prices using a dataset of economic indicators and historical market data. The workflow encompasses data preparation with Pandas for cleaning and handling missing values, exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Matplotlib and Seaborn to uncover trends and correlations, and feature engineering to develop relevant features like moving averages. The model training is performed using RandomForestRegressor from Scikit-learn, evaluated with metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared. Additionally, time-series analysis is applied to capture temporal dependencies, and interactive visualizations with Plotly enhance the
			 exploration of data trends and model predictions. </p>

		This project showcases a comprehensive spam detection system built using machine learning techniques. The system classifies emails into "spam" or "ham" based on their content. It starts by preprocessing and vectorizing the text data with a CountVectorizer, and then trains a Logistic Regression model to predict email categories. The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics, a confusion matrix, and a detailed classification report, with visualizations for class distribution, word frequency, and the ROC curve. For deployment, the model and vectorizer are saved and 
		integrated into a Streamlit web application. This app allows users to input email text and receive real-time spam predictions, demonstrating the model's effectiveness with training accuracy of 99.80% and validation accuracy of 98.03%.
